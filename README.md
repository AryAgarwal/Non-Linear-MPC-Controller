# Non-Linear-MPC-Controller
As a memeber of the Controls and Path Planning in teh Driverless subsystem at Formula Manipal, I developed this controller that is able to control the steeering, acceleration and braking of the car.
It takes into account the constraints of the track as well as the friction created by the tires. It takes the best possible path around the track, giving the fastest lap time.
